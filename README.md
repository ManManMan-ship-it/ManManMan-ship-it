- 🌱 I’m currently learning SuSv3,posix, C, assembly, and more.

ManManMan-ship-it/ManManMan-ship-it likes to read. ManManMan-ship-it/ManManMan-ship-it likes to share resources. 
--->The more ManManMan-ship-it learns, the less ManManMan-ship-it knows. 

ManManMan-ship-it knows the journey is the destination. Books that make my brain hurt are my favorite:
Gravity's Rainbow
Infinite Jest
Susv specs
Man pages
Emacs info pages
Arcane assembly tables
... stay tuned for repos packed with an overabundance of specificity.
